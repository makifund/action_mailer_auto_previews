  "body": "# ActionMailerAutoPreviews\r\n\r\nWelcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/action_mailer_auto_previews`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.\r\n\r\nTODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile :development group:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngroup :development do\r\n  gem 'action_mailer_auto_previews'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install action_mailer_auto_previews\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThat's it! Simply include the gem in your Gemfile's :development group, and by default, you will be able to automatically see previews of your ActionMailer emails. Whenever `deliver` or `deliver_later`\r\nis called on one of your ActionMailers, the gem will automatically generate the ActionMailer::Preview required and open the preview in your default browser. However, there are several configuration options\r\nthat can be used to alter this behavior.\r\n\r\n## Configuration Options\r\n```ruby\r\nActionMailerAutoPreviews.setup do |config|\r\n  config.enabled = true\r\n  config.history_limit = 10\r\n  config.intercept_mode = :preview_only # [:preview_only, :preview_and_deliver]\r\n  config.launch_browser = true\r\n  config.logger = Rails.logger\r\n  config.preview_host_url = \"http://localhost:3000\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/makifund/action_mailer_auto_previews.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n\r\n",
